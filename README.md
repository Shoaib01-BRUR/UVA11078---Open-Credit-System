# UVA11078---Open-Credit-System
In an open credit system, the students can choose any course they like, but there is a problem. Some of the students are more senior than other students. The professor of such a course has found quite a number of such students who came from senior classes (as if they came to attend the pre requisite course after passing an advanced course). But he wants to do justice to the new students. So, he is going to take a placement test (basically an IQ test) to assess the level of difference among the students. He wants to know the maximum amount of score that a senior student gets more than any junior student. For example, if a senior student gets 80 and a junior student gets 70, then this amount is 10. Be careful that we donâ€™t want the absolute value. Help the professor to figure out a solution.
